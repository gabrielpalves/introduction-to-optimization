# introduction-to-optimization
Codes used in the discipline Introduction to Optimization.

In order to run all codes, you will need the following libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- sympy
- matplotlib

To install them, use in the terminal "pip install numpy", for example, or insert in a cell of the jupyter notebook "pip install numpy".
Repeat this for all other libraries.

Plots were implemented to visualize the optimization.
From lesson 7 onwards, the plots show the equality and inequality constraints.

You can contribute to the codes of this repository or you can leave a comment with your suggestions at will.
