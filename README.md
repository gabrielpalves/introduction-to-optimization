Codes used in the discipline Introduction to Optimization.
Download all the folder to run a specific problem.
The mainscripts are the jupyter notebooks, except in "Aula 08", which is "Python Aula 08.py".

### Requirements
In order to run all codes, you will need the following libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- sympy
- matplotlib

You can run in the terminal
    pip install -r requirements.txt
Or you can install them one by one, using in the terminal
    pip install numpy
for example, or insert in a cell of the jupyter notebook
    pip install numpy

### Changes
Plots were implemented to visualize the optimization.
From lesson 7 onwards, the plots show the equality and inequality constraints.

### Contribution
You can contribute to the codes of this repository or you can leave a comment with your suggestions at will.
